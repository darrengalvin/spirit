Monopile: The most common type for shallow waters (up to 30m), consisting of a large steel tube driven into the seabed.\n        \n        2. Gravity Base: Suitable for waters up to 60m deep, these are large concrete structures that rely on their weight for stability.\n        \n        3. Jacket: Used in deeper waters (30-80m), these are steel lattice structures fixed to the seabed with piles.\n        \n        4. Floating: For very deep waters (60m+), these foundations are anchored to the seabed and float on the surface.\n        \n        5. Suction Bucket: A newer technology where a steel bucket is lowered to the seabed and then pumped empty, creating a vacuum that pulls it into place.\n\n        Each type has its advantages and is chosen based on factors like water depth, seabed geology, turbine size, and cost-effectiveness."},{title:"Regular inspections and preventative maintenance",description:"Understand the importance of routine checks and maintenance",content:"Regular inspections and preventative maintenance are crucial for ensuring the longevity and safety of offshore wind foundations.
